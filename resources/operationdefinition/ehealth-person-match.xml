A bundle contain a set of Person records that represent possible matches, optionally it may also contain an OperationOutcome with further information about the search results (such as warnings or information messages, such as a count of records that were close but eliminated)

If the operation was unsuccessful, then an OperationOutcome may be returned along with a BadRequest status Code (e.g. security issue, or insufficient properties in person fragment - check against profile)

Note: as this the only out parameter, it is a resource, and it has the name 'return', the result of this operation is returned directly as a resource"/>
