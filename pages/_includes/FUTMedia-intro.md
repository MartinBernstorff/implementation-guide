Some Observations may be accompanied by media. E.g. images. 

It is possible to search for Media based on:
* context 
* subject
* code
* period
* deviceMeasuringQuality
* situationQuality
* operationQuality

At least one of "subject" and "context" must be provided. "period" searches on range of "occurence".
