# Introduction
 
The FHIR resource CommunicationRequest is used to customize how and when Communications are received.
 
CommunicationRequests govern `ehealth-message` communications sent to CareTeams or Patients.

Supported types of messages:
* Messages generated by automated processing. E.g. Measurement outside reference range.
* Missing measurements
* Unexpected measurements
   
# Scope and Usage
* `basedOn` Reference to a ProcedureRequest. The CommunicationRequest applies to messages about measurements based on this procedureRequest.
* `recipient` Reference to either CareTeam or Patient recipient. The CommunicationsRequest applies to messages sent to these recipients. 
* `category` The CommunicationsRequest applies to messages with this category.
* `priority` The CommunicationsRequest applies to messages about tasks with this category.
* `status` If status is 'active' then messages will be processed and created. If status is 'suspended' then no messages will be created.
* `medium` This will override the default medium for the message.
* `payload` This will override the default payload for a message to a patient.

If multiple CommunicationRequests for the same recipient are found, then only the newest is considered valid.
