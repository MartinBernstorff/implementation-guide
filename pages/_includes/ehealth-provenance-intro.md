In certain circumstances data from Observations and QuestionnaireResponses can be reused. When this happens, a Provenance resource will identify the source of the original data.

Provenance also covers state for messages, such as whether a message has been read/acknowledged (activity=read), time limited validity on notifications (using "period") etc.

Provenance is also used to link correlated resources submitted together.
