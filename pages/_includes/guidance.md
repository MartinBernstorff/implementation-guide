## General Guidance

### Introduction to Domain
Introduction to the eHealth domain can be found at the [wiki site](https://ehealth-dk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EDTW/).

### Modeling Approach
The eHealth Infrastructure is based on an open modeling approach to using FHIR. With the open modeling, optional elements of
the various FHIR resources have been retained even when not included in the initial data requirements. This except the few 
odd occurrences where elements have been removed to reduce they ways in which resources can be connected as the fewer ways
suffice.

Compared to the closed modeling approach, where those (initially) superfluous elements are removed, the open modeling approach
is prepared for adaptation. It enables an evolutionary use of elements where parties can agree on supporting otherwise
unused elements for, say, pilot projects and then propagate use of the elements once proven valuable. This without
interfering with regular use of the resources. 

### Security
eHealth Infrastructure security mechanisms are described on the [wiki site](https://ehealth-dk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EDTW/).
